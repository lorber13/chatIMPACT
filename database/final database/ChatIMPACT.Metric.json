Here, the length of the references and hypotheses lists need to be the same, so you may need to transpose your references compared to sacrebleuâ€™s required input format. See https://github.com/huggingface/datasets/issues/3154#issuecomment-950746534\n\nSee the sacreBLEU README.md for more information.",
